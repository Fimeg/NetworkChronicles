# GitHub Migration Strategy - Network Chronicles 2.0

This document outlines the strategy for migrating to Network Chronicles 2.0 with minimal disruption to the community.

## üéØ Migration Approach: "Clean Slate with Bridge"

### Core Strategy
1. **New primary branch**: `main` becomes Network Chronicles 2.0
2. **Legacy preservation**: Create `legacy-v1` branch for old version
3. **Clear communication**: Extensive documentation and migration guides
4. **Community-first**: Prioritize user experience over technical convenience

## üìã Pre-Migration Checklist

### Repository Preparation
- [ ] Create comprehensive backup of all branches
- [ ] Document all existing issues and link to new equivalents
- [ ] Archive old discussions that are no longer relevant
- [ ] Create migration timeline and communicate to community

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update README with clear version information
- [ ] Create BREAKING_CHANGES.md with detailed migration info
- [ ] Add prominent notices about version differences
- [ ] Update all links and references to reflect new structure

### Community Communication
- [ ] Issue announcement about upcoming migration
- [ ] Email notification to watch/star list (if available)
- [ ] Update social media and external references
- [ ] Create FAQ for common migration questions

## üöÄ Migration Timeline

### Phase 1: Preparation (Week 1)
- **Day 1-2**: Create migration branches and backups
- **Day 3-4**: Update documentation and prepare announcements
- **Day 5-7**: Community notification and feedback collection

### Phase 2: Migration (Week 2)
- **Day 1**: Create legacy branch and archive old main
- **Day 2**: Deploy Network Chronicles 2.0 to main branch
- **Day 3-4**: Update all repository settings and metadata
- **Day 5-7**: Monitor community response and address issues

### Phase 3: Support (Ongoing)
- **Month 1**: Active support for migration questions
- **Month 2-3**: Bug fixes and compatibility improvements
- **Month 3+**: Focus on new feature development

## üìÇ Branch Structure After Migration

```
main                     # Network Chronicles 2.0 (default)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ legacy-v1           # Original Network Chronicles (archived)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alpha-testing       # Alpha release branch
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ experimental        # Experimental features
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ community-content   # Community contributions staging
```

## üîß Repository Settings Changes

### Branch Protection
- Set `main` as default branch
- Require PR reviews for `main`
- Enable status checks for CI/CD
- Protect `legacy-v1` from accidental changes

### Labels Update
```
Version Labels:
- v2.0-alpha        # For alpha testing issues
- v2.0-bug          # Version 2.0 specific bugs  
- v2.0-enhancement  # Version 2.0 improvements
- legacy-v1         # Issues related to old version
- migration-help    # Migration assistance needed

Priority Labels:
- critical          # Blocking issues
- high-priority     # Important improvements
- community-request # Community-driven features
- alpha-feedback    # Alpha tester feedback
```

### Issue Templates
Create new templates for:
- Bug reports (2.0 specific)
- Feature requests
- Migration assistance
- Alpha testing feedback
- Community content contributions
