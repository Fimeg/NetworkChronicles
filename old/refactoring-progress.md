# Network Chronicles Refactoring Progress

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Utility Scripts Creation
- Created `/bin/utils/directory-management.sh` to centralize directory creation logic
- Created `/bin/utils/config.sh` to standardize path configuration and access
- Created `/bin/utils/json-helpers.sh` to provide standardized JSON operations
- Created `/bin/utils/script-template.sh` as a template for new scripts

### 2. Scripts Refactored

#### Core System Scripts
- **check-add-documents.sh**: Updated to use the directory-management utility
- **fix-documents.sh**: Simplified to use utility functions
- **restore-player-documents.sh**: Updated to use utility functions
- **network-chronicles-engine.sh**: 
  - Refactored player initialization to use utility functions
  - Updated display_status function to use utility functions
  - Refactored get_player_state and update_player_state to use utility functions
  - Refactored add_discovery to use json-helpers
  - Refactored complete_quest to use json-helpers
  - Refactored check_quest_requirements to use json-helpers

#### Player Interface Scripts
- **journal.sh**: 
  - Updated to use utility functions for directory management
  - Refactored JSON operations to use json-helpers
  - Improved all JSON handling with standardized functions
- **network-map.sh**:
  - Updated to use configuration utilities for paths
  - Improved discovery data retrieval from player profile
  - Enhanced map export functionality using document paths
  - Added progress bar for discovery visualization
  - Better integration with player state
- **nc-shell-integration.sh**:
  - Updated imports to use utility scripts
  - Refactored prompt generation to use json-helpers
  - Updated command wrappers to use utility functions
  - Added Documents directory check on shell startup

#### Game Content Scripts
- **content/events/onboarding.sh**:
  - Updated to use json-helpers for player state management
  - Refactored to use directory-management utility

#### Setup and Installation Scripts
- **setup-demo.sh**:
  - Updated to install utility scripts
  - Refactored to use directory-management utility for directory creation
- **bin/manual-setup-enhanced.sh**:
  - Updated to install and use utility scripts
  - Refactored to use directory-management utility

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Eliminated Duplication**: Documents directory creation logic is now centralized in one place
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Path configurations are now managed centrally
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: JSON operations now have consistent error handling
4. **Standardized Code Style**: Scripts now follow a consistent pattern with proper headers
5. **Better Modularity**: Functions are now better organized and isolated

## Next Steps

### 1. Continue Refactoring
- Update the remaining parts of network-chronicles-engine.sh to use utility functions
- Refactor setup and installation scripts to use utility functions
- Update any remaining scripts that create Documents folders

### 2. Testing
- Test all refactored scripts to ensure they work correctly
- Verify that the game still functions as expected

### 3. Additional Improvements
- Create comprehensive documentation for the utility functions
- Set up consistent logging across all scripts
- Improve error handling further

## Documentation

### How to Use the Utility Functions

#### Directory Management
```bash
# Import the utility script
source "/path/to/bin/utils/directory-management.sh"

# Ensure player documents directory exists
ensure_player_documents "player_id"

# Ensure all required game directories exist
ensure_game_directories
```

#### Configuration
```bash
# Import the configuration module
source "/path/to/bin/utils/config.sh"

# Get player directories
player_state=$(get_player_state_dir "player_id")
docs_dir=$(get_player_docs_dir "player_id")
journal_dir=$(get_player_journal_dir "player_id")
profile_path=$(get_player_profile "player_id")
```

#### JSON Helpers
```bash
# Import the JSON helpers
source "/path/to/bin/utils/json-helpers.sh"

# Update a field in a JSON file
json_update_field "file.json" ".field.path" "new_value"

# Get a value from a JSON file
value=$(json_get_value "file.json" ".field.path")

# Add an item to a JSON array
json_add_to_array "file.json" ".array_path" "item_json"

# Add a player notification
add_player_notification "player_id" "Notification message"
```
