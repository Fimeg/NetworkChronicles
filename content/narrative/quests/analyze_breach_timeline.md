# Analyze Breach Timeline

Now that you've secured the vulnerable service, it's time to understand what happened during the breach and determine how it relates to The Architect's disappearance. Creating a timeline of events will help you understand what happened and possibly provide clues about where The Architect went.

## Objectives

1. Analyze the logs to establish when the attack began
2. Compare attack timestamps with The Architect's last login and logout times
3. Create a timeline document showing the sequence of events
4. Look for any hidden messages or patterns in the timeline

## Hints

- Look for patterns in the auth.log entries
- The Architect's last login and logout times may be significant
- Try to correlate attack events with system changes or other activities
- Check for any files modified around the time of the breach

## Rewards

- Timeline analysis tool
- Advanced Security Specialist Badge (Tier 1)
- XP towards Tier 2 access
- Access to The Architect's hidden message system
