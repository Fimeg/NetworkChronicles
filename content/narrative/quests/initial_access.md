# First Contact

You've been suddenly appointed as the new system administrator after the mysterious disappearance of your predecessor, known only as "The Architect."

Your first task is to find any messages or instructions The Architect may have left behind.

## Mission Objectives

1. Locate The Architect's hidden welcome message
2. Use the `nc-add-discovery welcome_message` command to acknowledge receipt
3. Begin mapping the network infrastructure

## Operational Notes

* Hidden files and directories in Linux begin with a dot (.)
* Use `ls -la` to list all files, including hidden ones
* The Architect was known to use unconventional locations for important information
* Look in standard Linux hidden directories like `.local/share`

## Security Advisory

Be cautious. Whatever The Architect discovered may have led to their disappearance. Make your investigation appear as routine system administration.
