### Current Objective: Discover Network Services

**Briefing:** Having investigated the initial suspicious traffic, it's time to get a clearer picture of what's actually running on this network. The Architect likely had various services deployed, some standard, some perhaps custom or hidden. Mapping these services is crucial for understanding the infrastructure and potential vulnerabilities.

**Tasks:**
- Use network scanning tools to identify listening ports and services on the local machine.
- If you identify other hosts on the network (e.g., via `ip neigh` or previous discoveries), attempt to scan them as well.
- Document the discovered services, their ports, and potential purposes in your journal or documentation files.
- Pay attention to any services running on non-standard ports.

**Hints:**
- The command `nc-discover-services.sh` is designed for this task. Run it without arguments to scan the local machine.
- You can also try scanning specific IP addresses you've discovered using `nc-discover-services.sh [target_ip]`.
- Tools like `ss -tuln`, `netstat -tuln`, or `nmap` (if installed) can provide service information.
- The discovery `services_scan_complete` will be logged once you successfully run the discovery script.

**Objective:** Create a comprehensive inventory of active network services to understand the system's functionality and potential attack surface.
