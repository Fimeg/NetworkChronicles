### Current Objective: Secure Vulnerable Service

**Briefing:** Your service scan revealed the active components on the network. However, not all services are configured securely. The Architect might have left something exposed, or perhaps the attackers exploited an existing weakness. You need to identify and remediate a critical vulnerability.

**Tasks:**
- Review the documentation generated by `nc-discover-services.sh` (in `~/.local/share/network-chronicles/documentation/network/services/` or `hosts/`).
- Pay close attention to services running on default ports that might be misconfigured or outdated (e.g., an exposed database, an old web server version, an FTP server).
- **Scenario:** Let's assume an "Old Web Service" running on port 8088 is identified as vulnerable (we'll simulate this).
- Research common vulnerabilities associated with the identified service type.
- Implement a security measure. For this scenario, let's simulate securing it by "disabling" the service (we'll use a command that triggers the completion).

**Hints:**
- The discovery `vulnerable_service_identified` will be logged when you examine the details of the simulated vulnerable service (e.g., `cat ~/.local/share/network-chronicles/documentation/network/services/old_web_service.txt`).
- To complete the quest, simulate securing the service by running a specific command like: `nc-secure-service old_web_service`. This command will trigger the `vulnerable_service_secured` discovery. (We will need to create this command/trigger/event).

**Objective:** Identify a vulnerable service based on scan results and implement a basic security measure to mitigate the risk.
