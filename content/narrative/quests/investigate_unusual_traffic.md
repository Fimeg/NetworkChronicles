### Current Objective: Investigate Unusual Traffic

**Briefing:** The Architect mentioned unusual traffic patterns and potential compromises before disappearing. Your network mapping confirms basic connectivity, but something feels off. You need to dig deeper into system activity.

**Tasks:**
- Examine system authentication logs (`/var/log/auth.log` or similar) for suspicious login attempts.
- Analyze network connection logs or use tools like `ss` or `netstat` to identify strange connections.
- Look for patterns involving external IP addresses, especially repeated failed attempts or connections at odd hours.
- Correlate findings with The Architect's known last login time.

**Hints:**
- Pay close attention to failed login attempts from unfamiliar IP addresses.
- The `grep` command is useful for searching log files for specific patterns (e.g., IP addresses, usernames, "failed").
- The discovery `unusual_traffic` will be logged automatically when you investigate the relevant logs or network states.

**Objective:** Identify and document the source of the suspicious activity to understand the potential threat The Architect faced.
