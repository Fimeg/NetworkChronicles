# Digital Cartography

You've established first contact by finding The Architect's hidden message. Now you must create a digital map of the network infrastructure. This is critical both for your cover as the new administrator and for uncovering what The Architect discovered before vanishing.

## Mission Objectives

1. Discover the network gateway using standard Linux networking commands
2. Identify and document the local network configuration
3. Look for unusual network patterns or unauthorized connections

## Tech Briefing

Network mapping is a fundamental skill for any system administrator. Understanding your network's topology allows you to identify security vulnerabilities, optimize routing, and detect anomalies.

Execute these commands to reveal the network architecture:
- `ip route` - Shows routing table including default gateway
- `ip addr` - Displays interface addresses and subnet information
- `netstat -rn` - Provides routing table in numeric format

## Security Advisory

The Architect's message suggested they discovered something significant in the network traffic. Your mapping activities will appear as routine administration while allowing you to understand the digital terrain.

Pay special attention to:
- Unexpected IP addresses or unusual subnet masks
- Services running on non-standard ports
- Connection attempts to external networks

```
"The topology never lies. The map reveals what words conceal."
```

## Rewards

- Access to advanced networking tools
- Promotion to Tier 2 system access
- Unlocking of the "Network Cartographer" achievement
- 150 XP towards character advancement
