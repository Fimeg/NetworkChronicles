## Overview

Network Chronicles revolutionizes technical documentation by transforming it from a passive reading experience into an interactive adventure. By embedding critical infrastructure knowledge within an engaging narrative framework, it addresses the fundamental challenge of IT documentation: making it compelling enough that people actually want to engage with it.

Players assume the role of a new system administrator tasked with maintaining a network after the mysterious disappearance of their predecessor, known only as "The Architect." Through exploration, puzzle-solving, and documentation, players uncover both the network's secrets and the truth behind The Architect's vanishing.
