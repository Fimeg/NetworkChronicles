### Stay with v1.x if:
- ‚úÖ You have extensive customizations that work well
- ‚úÖ Your setup is stable and meets your needs
- ‚úÖ You prefer pure shell script implementation
- ‚úÖ You want to avoid learning new interface

### Migrate to v2.0 if:

## üîÑ Migration Paths

### Path 1: Fresh Start (Recommended)
**Best for**: Most users wanting the full v2.0 experience

1. **Backup your v1.x setup**:
   ```bash
   # Create backup directory
   mkdir ~/network-chronicles-v1-backup
   
   # Copy your existing installation
   cp -r /opt/network-chronicles ~/network-chronicles-v1-backup/
   cp -r ~/.config/network-chronicles ~/network-chronicles-v1-backup/config/
   
   # Export your player data if customized
   cp -r ~/.local/share/network-chronicles ~/network-chronicles-v1-backup/data/
   ```

2. **Install v2.0 fresh**:
   ```bash
   # Clone the new version
   git clone https://github.com/network-chronicles/network-chronicles.git
   cd network-chronicles
   
   # Install dependencies and build
   npm install
   npm run build
   
   # Start the application
   npm run serve
   ```

3. **Access via web browser**:
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Begin fresh learning journey

### Path 2: Side-by-Side Setup
**Best for**: Users who want to keep both versions

1. **Keep v1.x installation** in current location
2. **Install v2.0 in different directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/network-chronicles-2.0
   cd ~/network-chronicles-2.0
   git clone https://github.com/network-chronicles/network-chronicles.git .
   npm install && npm run build
   ```

3. **Use different ports** if running simultaneously:
   ```bash
   # v2.0 on custom port
   PORT=3001 npm run serve
   ```

### Path 3: Docker Migration
**Best for**: Users wanting containerized deployment

1. **Backup existing data** (same as Path 1)
2. **Use Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/network-chronicles/network-chronicles.git
   cd network-chronicles
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access at http://localhost:3000**

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Migration (Manual)

While automatic migration isn't supported, you can manually transfer some concepts:

### Player Progress
v1.x stored progress in files. In v2.0, you can:

1. **Review your v1.x achievements**:
   ```bash
   # Check your old progress
   cat ~/.local/share/network-chronicles/player_profile.json
   ```

2. **Set similar progress in v2.0**:
   - Use the web interface to progress through quests
   - Your learning experience will be enhanced with new narrative

### Custom Commands
v1.x custom commands can inspire v2.0 contributions:

1. **Document your v1.x customizations**
2. **Contribute to v2.0** using the [content contribution system](CONTRIBUTING_NARRATIVE.md)
3. **Share with the community** to benefit everyone

### Configuration Preferences
Some preferences can be manually applied:

```javascript
// v2.0 preferences (stored in browser localStorage)
{
  "terminalTheme": "cyberpunk",
  "difficultyLevel": "intermediate", 
  "showHints": true,
  "enableCRTEffects": true
}
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting Migration Issues

### Common Problems

#### "Can't find v1.x installation"
- Check `/opt/network-chronicles` and `~/.local/share/network-chronicles`
- Look for shell integration in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`

#### "v2.0 won't start"
- Ensure Node.js 16+ is installed: `node --version`
- Check for port conflicts: `lsof -i :3000`
- Review build logs: `npm run build`

#### "Missing my old progress"
- v2.0 progress is separate and starts fresh
- Consider this an opportunity to experience improved learning path

#### "Performance issues"
- v2.0 is web-based and requires modern browser
- Minimum requirements: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+

### Getting Help

1. **Check documentation**: [ALPHA_TESTING.md](ALPHA_TESTING.md)
2. **Search existing issues**: Use GitHub issue search
3. **Create migration issue**: Use `migration-help` label
4. **Community discussions**: Ask in GitHub Discussions
